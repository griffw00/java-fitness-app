# Task 1

**Fitness Planner**

# Task 2

This application will allow the user to create an exercise schedule for each day of the week (i.e. Monday to Sunday).
This application is intended for anyone that wants to get into exercising and wants to keep track of their
current exercise plan. I am passionate about this project because I regularly exercise to stay healthy and keep track 
of my exercises using the native Notes app on iPhone. However, my quality of life would be improved if I had access to 
an application that is tailored for documenting my exercise plan. 

**For example:**

*Monday*
- 3 x 10 push-ups [x]
- 3 x 8 pull-ups []
- 15 minutes cardio []

*Tuesday*
- Rest

*Wednesday*
- 3 x 10 push-ups [x]
- 3 x 15 sit-ups []
- 3 x 20 jumping jacks []
- 15 minutes cardio []

*etc.*


# Task 3

*User Stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to add any exercise to any given day of the week
- As a user, I want to be able to view all my exercises for any given day of the week
- As a user, I want to be able to modify the intensity of my exercises for any given day of the week
- As a user, I want to be able to indicate the exercises I have completed
- As a user, I want to be able to swap the exercises between two days
- As a user, I want to be able to save my exercise schedule 
- As a user, I want to be able to load my exercise schedule, if I so choose

NOTE: I added one additional user story where the user can swap exercises 
between two days
